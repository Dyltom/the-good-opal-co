---

Create a new page template:

1. Ask the user what type of template (e.g., "Restaurant", "Service Business", "Professional")
2. Create a new component file in `src/components/templates/`
3. Set up the basic structure with sections:
   - Hero section
   - About section
   - Services/Products section
   - Contact section
   - Footer
4. Use existing components from `src/components/sections/` where possible
5. Add TypeScript props interface for customization
6. Include comments explaining template structure
7. Update the template registry if it exists
