## Architecture

### Multi-Tenant Approach

This framework uses a **multi-tenant architecture** where:
- Single codebase serves multiple client websites
- Each client has isolated data via database tenancy
- Clients access their own admin panel with scoped permissions
- Subdomains or custom domains route to the correct tenant
- Shared infrastructure = lower costs per client

**Benefits:**
- Deploy once, serve many clients
- Single version of code to maintain
- Updates propagate automatically
- Cost-effective: $0.40-2/month per site on shared infrastructure
- Easy to manage and scale

**When to Use Separate Deployments:**
- Enterprise clients needing dedicated resources
- High isolation/security requirements
- Heavy customization beyond template capabilities

## Research Findings

### Why These Technologies?

#### Payload CMS 3.0
- **Next.js Native**: Installs directly into Next.js apps (single codebase)
- **Free & Open Source**: No licensing costs
- **Developer-Friendly**: TypeScript, GraphQL, REST APIs
- **Flexible**: Works with PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite
- **Production-Ready**: Built-in job queues, file uploads, admin UI

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Sanity: Great collaboration features but $99/mo for teams, costs scale
- Strapi: Popular but separate deployment, heavier
- Contentful: Enterprise pricing, overkill for small business

#### shadcn/ui
- **Copy-Paste Approach**: Full control, no lock-in
- **Easy Theming**: CSS variables make recoloring simple
- **No Dependencies**: Components live in your codebase
- **Tailwind Integration**: Works seamlessly

**Enhancement Libraries:**
- **Magic UI**: 50+ animated components built on shadcn
- **Aceternity UI**: Beautiful Framer Motion components for marketing sites

#### Cal.com
- **Open Source**: Self-host or embed
- **Next.js Based**: Perfect integration
- **Feature-Rich**: Google Calendar, Zoom, payment integrations
- **Customizable**: Full API and webhook support

**Alternatives:**
- Google Calendar API: Free, simpler, less features
- Calendly embed: Quick but limited, not self-hosted
- Custom build: More work, full control

### Deployment Strategy

#### Coolify (Recommended)
- Open-source, self-hostable Heroku alternative
- Built-in CI/CD from GitHub
- Automatic SSL certificates
- One-click deployments
- Docker-based with Nixpacks support

**Requirements:**
- Minimum 8GB RAM for Next.js builds
- 2vCPU insufficient, 4vCPU+ recommended

**Cost Analysis:**
- VPS (8GB RAM): $20-40/month (Hetzner, DigitalOcean)
- Can host 20-50+ small sites per instance
- **Cost per site: $0.40-2/month**

**Pricing Model for Clients:**
- Setup: $500-2000 (one-time)
- Monthly: $50-150/client
- Your margin: ~95%+ on hosting
